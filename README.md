# Chi-Square-Test


## Chi-Square-Test of independence
* A chi-square (Χ2) test of independence allows you to draw conclusions about a population based on a sample.
* Use to test whether two categorical variables are related to each other in population
* means If two variables are related, the probability of one variable having a certain value is dependent on the value of the other variable.

Contingency tables
In chi-square test of independence, the best way to organize your data is  contingency table.
A contingency table, also known as a cross tabulation, shows the number of observations in each combination of groups. It also usually includes row and column totals.

## # Whether to reject the null hypothesis
* If the Χ2 value is greater than the critical value, then the difference between the observed and expected distributions is statistically significant (p <  α).
The data allows you to reject the null hypothesis that the variables are unrelated and provides support for the alternative hypothesis that the variables are related.
* If the Χ2 value is less than the critical value, then the difference between the observed and expected distributions is not statistically significant (p >  α).
The data doesn’t allow you to reject the null hypothesis that the variables are unrelated and doesn’t provide support for the alternative hypothesis that the variables are related.
